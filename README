DESCRIPTION
===========
Allows users to tag postings as "politically incorrect", asking the author to mind their wording. Sounds crazy? Hell yeah! But it works just like the well-known "Thanks" buttons, except conveying a slightly different message. In fact, this plugin is based on the "Thankful people" plugin by Jerl Linandri. It shares a version number with the Thankful People release it is based on.
Remake of classic Vanilla One extension.
